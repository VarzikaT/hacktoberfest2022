    Approach - Recursion - Brute force .
    We need to try to put both the + and - symbols at every location in the given nums array and find out the assignments which lead to the required result S.

    We always append a + sign and a - sign both to the element at the current index and calls itself with the updated sum as sum + nums[i]  and sum - nums[i] respectively along with the updated current index as i+1. Whenever we reach the end of the array, we compare the sum obtained with SS. If they are equal, we increment the countcount value to be returned.

    Time - O(2^N)  Space - O(N)


    Other Method - This Question is similar to count of Subset with Given Diff , here sum is equal to diff only

    üÖæ Explanation -  if we assign + or - sign before numbers , they eventually become two subsets one containing all -ve elememnts and other all posiitves and if we add those two subsets we get the diff between them.

// Approach - Dynamic Programming üî•‚úÖ
// Intution - if we assign + or - sign before numbers , they eventually become two subsets one containing all -ve elememnts and other all posiitves and if we find diff b/w them that is our answer target.

// Similar to Count of Subset Sum with given Diff - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùï‚ùï‚ùï
//  nums : [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1], target = 1.
// The solution doesn't consider presence of "0"s in the array. Why the output is different ?
// Because, if we have "0", then, it can have +0 and -0 and still will not effect the sum of a set.
// For example: Target value is = 2
// 1) {0,2} = {+0,2}, {-0,2}.  Ans: 2
// But if we increase number of 0s,
// 2) {0,0,2} = {+0,+0,2}, {+0,-0,2}, {-0,+0,2},{-0,-0,2} . Ans: 4

// ‚ùó‚ùï So, if you observe, your answer increase by (2^number of 0s) i.e. pow(2,number of zeros).

// other cases we need to handle is:
// if(target < total_Sum || (total_Sum + target )% 2 != 0)
